# ModularSynthStuff
Mostly Eurorack modules. Mostly designed by me.

# Doei
Doei is a headphone amp, based on the CMoy schematic. Prototype tested. V1 not tested yet.

To Do: Redesign panel. Add instructions.


# PACO!
PACO! is a simple routing module, double signal splitter or bypasser. It's just a bunch of jacks connected to a toggle switch.

To Do: Add photos. Find toggleswitch that fits footprint.


# Tuner
Handy for keeping your synth in tune during gigs. It's a Eurorack recreation of LMNC's tuner schematic, as seen in his VCO module.

The module is 5HP wide. It only takes power from the +12V rail and converts it to 5V.

To Do: Test V1. Make panel look cooler. Add a mounting hole to connect to the panel better.
